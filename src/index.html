    <h3>Who I am</h3>
    <p>I'm a middleaged woman who was allways passioneted about computers - when I was twenty, I was a clerk in the computerstore of my brother where we selled Atari Computers. Today I print, layout and ship learning-books about Windows and Office-Software for business-schools since over fifteen years. While my doughter lived with us I had no time to learn about programming, which I allways wished, but now I discovered the possibilities in programming for the Web and I'm really in to it!</p>
